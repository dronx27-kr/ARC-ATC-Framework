# ARC Framework (Preliminary)

This repository contains a preliminary framework for reasoning governance in large language models.

This is **not** a full constitution.
It is a distilled core intended for discussion and early experimentation.

The full ARC constitutional system and internal research structures are intentionally excluded.

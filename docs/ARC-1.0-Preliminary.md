# ARC 1.0 — Preliminary Core

## Overview
ARC (Artificial Reasoning Chamber) is a research framework for structuring, governing,
and stabilizing reasoning processes in large language model systems.

This repository contains the Preliminary Core of ARC 1.0.
It is not a finalized academic system and not a complete constitutional release.

## Important Notice
- This document is Preliminary
- The full constitutional system (290 clauses) is intentionally withheld
- ARC is under active research and revision
- Feedback, critique, and discussion are welcome

## What ARC Is
- A framework for reasoning governance, not model training
- A structural approach to norm formation and stability
- A system for preventing reasoning drift and context contamination
- A research-oriented architecture

## What ARC Is Not
- Not a persona system
- Not prompt engineering
- Not fine-tuning or reinforcement learning
- Not a commercial AI product

## Scope of This Release
This repository presents:
- Core conceptual principles (ATC / m1.5)
- Observed structural failure modes in existing rule-based systems
- Preliminary definitions of autonomy, immersion, and narrative pacing

Excluded by design:
- Central Control Room (CCR) structures
- Session numbering systems
- Full experimental logs
- Full constitutional text (290 clauses)

## Status
This is a living research artifact.
Concepts may change as research progresses.

Contact and discussion are encouraged through public channels.
